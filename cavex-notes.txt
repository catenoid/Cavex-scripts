"Cavex": Cave exploration with concavity and convexity.

SPECIFICATIONS
Player navigates a 3D surface, viewed through an isometric projection.
Player can reflect world across the view vector.
The terrain appears identical, but concave surfaces become convex and vice-versa.
The camera rotates to preserve the direction of acceleration due to gravity.
Player can add triangular tiles to the surface to manipulate the terrain.
Due to the concave-convex relationship, adding tiles results in excavations in the alternative view.

--- Step goals ---
PLAYER INVERSION
Only allow inversion when the player is visible and grounded
Animate a smoother transition
Velocity transform for continuous motion

CAMERA
Facility to view hidden terrain: Conical rotation, or a first person perspective

SUN
When idle: advance every Update
On inversion:
 - Advance so sunset coincides with the end of camera's motion (Stall if night)
 - Return to idle at sunrise (or the time at inversion?)
Cancelling the flip should revert the sun to its position when the space bar was pressed

COMMENTS THAT DON'T FIT ELSEWHERE
What order are the Start() routines called in for inherited objects?

Potentially add support for walking on planes +x and +z
Rotate the camera and gravity vector +-120 degrees
