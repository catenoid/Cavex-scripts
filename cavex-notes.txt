"Cavex": Cave exploration with concavity and convexity.

SPECIFICATIONS
Player navigates a 3D surface, viewed through an isometric projection.
Player can reflect world across the view vector. The terrain appears identical, but concave surfaces become convex and vice-versa. The camera rotates to preserve the direction of acceleration due to gravity.
Player can add triangular tiles to the surface to manipulate the terrain. Due to the concave-convex relationship, adding tiles results in excavations in the alternative view.

--- Step goals ---
PLAYER MOVEMENT
Collision detection to prevent clipping through walls
Response to gravity
Jump ability, in a trajectory corresponding to the instantaneous planar velocity
Player object becomes it's reflection. Before transforming the position, reflect over the plane of contact
Player with spherical rigid body: Got to stop falling off the world when we flip. Freeze the ball, rotate the Physics.gravity vector

HIDDEN TERRAIN
Without inferring plane continuity, the player would fall through the hole in the floor behind features
To find the bounds of a feature, convex hull of a collection of 2D points?
Part of the interest was in areas only accessible in one view, where the player can slightly perturb the camera
In this case one mesh is flipped, and two meshes swap visibility

FLIPPING THE PLAYER
Player currently spherical, avoiding complications
What are the Euler angles to sensibly rotate a standing object?

CAMERA
Click and drag conical rotation. Will this be perspective or orthographic view?

COMMENTS THAT DON'T FIT ELSEWHERE
Either build the world in 3D and eviscerate occlusion, or draw as on isometric paper and infer 3D structure from edge concavity

What order are the Start() routines called in for inherited objects?

Triangulation
