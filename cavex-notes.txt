"Cavex": Cave exploration with concavity and convexity.

SPECIFICATIONS
Player navigates a 3D surface, viewed through an isometric projection.
Player can reflect world across the view vector. The terrain appears identical, but concave surfaces become convex and vice-versa. The camera rotates to preserve the direction of acceleration due to gravity.
Player can add triangular tiles to the surface to manipulate the terrain. Due to the concave-convex relationship, adding tiles results in excavations in the alternative view.

THE "YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS ALL WRONG" EPIPHANY MOMENT
Flip the visible mesh over the y plane and translate the camera, instead of using the current reflection matrix

PLAYER MOVEMENT
Currently the arrow keys adjust position, which appears unnatural when the ball is rolling.
Having keys impart a coplanar force makes more sense, but only applies to a spherical mesh collider.

FLIPPING THE PLAYER
Mesh renderer of player is currently spherical, avoiding complications
What are the Euler angles to sensibly rotate a standing object?
Only allow inversion when the player and player's reflection are visible.
Remove the direct references to the space bar

CAMERA
Click and drag conical rotation. Will this be perspective or orthographic view?
Alternatively, how about a smaller first person view in addition to the main camera?
Count the angular displacement from 0 to 180, in order to remove unnecessary if statements
Have the camera conduct the directional light

SUN
When idle: advance every Update
World invert command: Simultaneously,
 - Camera begins its rotation
 - Advance so sunset coincides with the end of camera's motion (Stall if night)
 - At sunset, invert visible meshes and alternate concave/convex meshes
 - Return to idle at sunrise (or the time at inversion?)
Cancelling the flip should revert the sun to its position when the space bar was pressed

COMMENTS THAT DON'T FIT ELSEWHERE
Either build the world in 3D and eviscerate occlusion, or draw as on isometric paper and infer 3D structure from edge concavity
What order are the Start() routines called in for inherited objects?
Triangulation
Setting the ball's velocity to zero prior to flipping doesn't seem necessary. In fact, without adds an interesting mechanism of "creating" momentum.

The ball's Y position is drifting from 0.5 after repeat flips. With a RigidBody on the sphere this is irrelevant.

Reflection probe zone: Objects enter it, they receive the cube map defined by the origin of the probe.
The sphere is not reflective, the *floor* is. So "size" irrelevant with only one probe in the scene?
"The zones of the full set of probes should collectively cover all areas of the scene where a reflective object might pass."
Why does the reflection look so terrible, regardless of resolution? Gah.
